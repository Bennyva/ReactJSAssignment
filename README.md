# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: ... Benjamin Vanarragon ...

## Overview.
...... This app is designed to be a productivity application where users can store their Excercises and work-outs. They are able to add a number of reps and sets for which excercise they did and some additional notes. Users can edit their work-outs as well.Users can also delete a work-out if they don't want that excercise appearing anymore on their dashboard for whatever reason. Users can search a database of excercises in the application, sort by text, or by muscle-group. They can click an item for further information on how to perform the excercise.  ........
